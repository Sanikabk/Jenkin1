# Reflection: Continuous Integration (CI)

## Introduction
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where code changes are frequently integrated into a shared repository and tested automatically. Tools like Jenkins automate this process, making development faster and more reliable. 

## Benefits of CI
- **Faster Feedback:** Automated builds and tests provide immediate feedback to developers.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Frequent integrations prevent merge conflicts and miscommunication.
- **Bug Detection:** Early detection ensures high-quality code.
- **Automation:** Reduces manual effort, increasing productivity.

## Challenges and Solutions
During this assignment, I faced challenges in configuring the Jenkins pipeline and connecting it to my GitHub repository. With the help of online resources and documentation, I was able to overcome these hurdles and successfully implement a CI pipeline.

## Conclusion
CI is essential for modern software development as it ensures faster, more reliable delivery of code. This assignment has enhanced my understanding of how CI benefits developers and improves the overall development process.
